We also have strings like \"Clay Soil\" and \"Wet Soil\". So we cannot separate these strings by just saying we need to split this by space. There are more rules to create. Ultimately, I took this entire column, and narrowed the possible strings down to just 11 possibilities. They are 'Air Pollution', 'Black Walnut', 'Clay Soil', 'Dry Soil', 'Wet Soil', 'Deer', 'ShallowRocky Soil', 'Drought', 'Erosion', 'Heavy Shade', and 'Rabbit'.
